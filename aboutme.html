Prodigy is a free, adaptive math game that integrates common-core math (grades 1-8) into a fantasy style game that students love playing.<br> And as a web-based game, Prodigy can be accessed at school and at home on virtually any device.
Prodigy is free for students to play, and there is no cost at all for teachers to implement it.<br> This premium membership does not provide any additional educational content, but instead gives students access to more in-game content, <br>such as items, treasure chests, and pets.
